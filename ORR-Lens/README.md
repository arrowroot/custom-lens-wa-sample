# Operational Readiness Review (ORR) Lens

Amazon Web Services (AWS) created the Operational Readiness Review (ORR) to distill the learnings from AWS operational incidents into curated questions with best practice guidance. Refer to the [ORR Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/). Within the Whitepaper [Appendix B](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-readiness-reviews/appendix-b-example-orr-questions.html) provides example ORR questions. The following ORR lens models those questions as a template to get started quickly building an ORR practice using WA custom lens as the tool. 


# Customize Well-Architected Reviews using Custom Lenses Sample Questionnaire

The AWS Well-Architected Tool makes it easy to create custom lenses by providing a json template that you can use. The template outlines how the lens content must be defined, and it controls how the lens is presented within the AWS WA Tool. This sample used the example questions from the ORR Whitepaper (see above) to show how to create Custom Lens in WA console from json template with the following several steps:
1. [Prepare your custom lens WA template json file](#prepare-your-custom-lens-WA-template-json-file)
2. [Navigate to the AWS WA Tool on the AWS console and create custom lens](#navigate-to-the-aws-wa-tool-on-the-aws-console-and-create-custom-lens)
3. [Publish your custom lens and attached with version tag](#publish-your-custom-lens-and-attached-with-version-tag)
4. [Review workloads using custom lenses](#review-workloads-using-custom-lenses)

## Prepare your custom lens WA template json file
Feel free to download the [ORR sample custom lens](https://github.com/aws-samples/custom-lens-wa-sample/blob/main/ORR-Lens/ORR-Whitepaper-Sample-PUBLISHED.json) and edit is as needed.

## Navigate to the AWS WA Tool on the AWS console and create custom lens
After you prepare your custom lens WA template json file, you can navigate to the AWS WA Tool on the AWS console and a create custom lens.

## Publish your custom lens and attached with version tag
You will find your custom lens WA in draft version.

Publish your draft version attached with version tag. After which the status will change from DRAFT to PUBLISHED

## Review workloads using custom lenses
After your custom lens WA is published, you can define a workload in your WA console to use the custom lens.
